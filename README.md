# module-9
This application is built using node.js to generate a README file. When the user invokes the application in the command line, they will get a series of questions regarding the project they are working on. When all the questions are answered, a README file will be made with all of their responses. This is done with the use of Inquirer. The fs module is also used to create the file.
